0,,Last year my Uber account has been hacked and used my card multiple times. Tonight the same thing has happened but I immediately logged into my account and removed my bank details. Uber needs to make their website/app more secure and take extra measures. What makes it worse is I canâ€™t get through to Uber.
1,,I got charged $35 for a 3.7 mile ride. A regular cab cost $13 for the same thing. I was quoted at $7. UBER RIP OFF! Do not use this company. Go with a regular cab.
