,I got charged $35 for a 3.7 mile ride. A regular cab cost $13 for the same thing. I was quoted at $7. UBER RIP OFF! Do not use this company. Go with a regular cab.
,"call only Uber and its customers. Drivers are out there making money for uber,  but Uber  bleeds their drivers from the other end with unreasonable fees, They don't cover your insurance or gas or repairs and everyday cosmetics of keeping your vehicle to their standards. A fellow driver was deactivated as a driver due to his NO DRUGS POLICEY in his vehicle he asked the customer not to use drugs in his car, and for this he was deactivated. He was sent to a ""affiliate"" program to be reactivated which he had to pay out of his own Pocket $50.00 for a 5 hour class he told me that 52 Desperate drivers came to the class and at the end of the class they were not given any grades or given some sort of certificate stating that they attended the class, so lets bring this into prospective 52 x 50. = 2600. for one day and if you do this in 10 major cities that's 26,000.00 in one day
Im not a disgruntled driver I still drive for them because I have a family to support and kids to put threw school.
This needed to be said and I hope Uber will listen and its customers will listen and make changes and stop bleeding their drivers"
,"Driver had no clue where to go. Waited for him over 30 minutes.
The car smelled like weed. Need I say more? Never again."
